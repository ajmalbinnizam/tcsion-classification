10,buprenorphine,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,major depression,"Subutex is mostly used to help opiate addicts withdrawal more comfortably from opiod drugs such as Vicodin, Oxycodone, and even Heroin. However, I was started on Subutex because my doctor and I were having no luck finding another med that would augment my current depression medications of Effexor XR and Adderall (which were only partially working). My doctor had found research suggesting that Subutex, because it is a partial opiate agonist itself (although much different in its properties compared to what most think of when thinking ""opiate""), binds to one of the opiate receptors in the brain responsible for mood. My doctor has always been on the cutting edge of current research and was extremely open-minded in trying this med with me - and to welcomed relief as well! I have had almost ALL good results from this medication. It has definitely aided in the treatment of my very-treatment-resistent depression. The following are the benefits that I have noticed from taking Subutex:
     1. Quick-acting - because Subutex is sublingual (dissolves under your tongue) it gets into your system immediately and does not have to be processed by your digestive system first.
     2. Gentle effects - I have definitly not experienced any ""highs"". Just a subtle, but noticeable improvement in a feeling of wellbeing.
     3. Also helps somewhat with anxiety by having a calming effect; in normal doses this happens without any tiredness.
     4. Have not noticed ANY of the side effects that I have found with other psychiatric medications such as weight gain/loss, personality changes, sexual effects, etc. Also, in case anyone is worried that Subutex is a ""partial-opiate agonist"", I must emphasize that this med DOES NOT build a tolerance or make you want/need to increase dosage. I have been on this dose for four years without ever even thinking about needing more. HOWEVER!!! You must understand that - as is the case with ALL psychiatric medications - you cannot simply stop taking this medication without tapering your dose first or you will experience withdrawal effects. The one saving grace about Subutex, though, is that it has a very long half-life and will remain in your system long enough to prevent any type of withdrawal even if you miss a day or two of medication.",None.,I take two 8mg tablets in the afternoon by putting them under my tongue and allowing them simply to dissolve.

Instead I went to a local pharmacy with the package of antibiotics I received from the doctors office and asked if I could buy 12 tablets. They were more than happy to sell them to me (at a fraction of the cost I paid at the doctors office) and I followed through with a 7 day course.

I suffered from impulsive behaviors, probably the most harmful/dangerous of them being binge-eating and bulimia.  Since taking Lamictal at 300mg for 4 months now my eating habits have become completely normal.  I have not purged in 3 months.  This is amazing.  I would binge eat and purge because of anxiety.  Now I feel like a normal person--not obsessed with food, I eat when I am hungry, stop when satiated.  I have lost a LOT of weight (20 pounds in 3 months without dieting/counting calories, etc.)...nothing was wrong with my metabolism, it was the impulsive eating, stealing food from others, throwing it up (which gave me a high--not just to get rid of the calories, but it calmed me...).  I love the Lamictal for this because it's not like some meds that make you lose weight by destroying the appetite.  I am just a normal person now!  

I also quit the Lexapro as it was triggering hypomanic episodes.  The Lamictal is stabilizing my moods--it doesn't numb the depression like the SSRIs I have been on.  I feel things.

10,bystolic,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,heart palpitations,"I have had SVT's all my life.  It was only when I turned 24 that I sought treatment for them as they usually were linked with a syncope episode.  I was originally put on the grandfather of beta/alpha blockers inderal.  While this drug was effective at treating my migraines, it was not particularly effective at controlling my palpitations and it tended to lower my blood pressure too much.  I always felt tired and had little energy on this drug.  At 24 years of age I was not happy to have the energy of a 65 year-old.  Next came atenolol and labatolol (when I was pregnant).  I also had break-through palpitations with these drugs as well as low-enegy side effects.  With labetolol I could barely jog down my street without becoming significantly winded and according to my cardiologist I fell into the 94th percentile for ""in-shape"" people my age.  Finally, when bystolic hit the market I was thrilled.  First of all I didn't need a large dose of it to be effective.  Second, it was effective.  I experience no break-through palpitations, and last but not least there were very few to no side effects.  I had energy again and I could get throught my cardiovascular exercise without becoming winded.","The beta blocker controls and regulates your heart beat so it beats on time when it's supposed to.  It also however, controls your heart rate and doesn't allow it to race out of control.  So when exercising, many people have a hard time being able to get their heart rate up to pump enough blood to the lungs which is why you feel winded while exercising even mildly.  With Bystolic there is very little of this type of side effect.  Sometimes I don't notice it at all.",I take 2.5mg of Bystolic one time per day to control palpitations.

10,suboxone,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,opioid addiction,"Suboxone is beneficial for two reasons:

1) It eliminated the opiate withdrawal when I was kicking my original drug of choice.

2) As a maintenance drug, Suboxone eliminates the cravings that I would normally have for opioids, as well as blocks the effects of agonist opioids (Heroin, Oxycodone, etc.) so that there is no temptation to take these drugs.

Instead of struggling every day to avoid taking opioid drugs (and all of the terrible thing that come with being in active addiction) I can take Suboxone and move on with life. 

Suboxone may have quite literally saved my life.","My only major complaint is that since Suboxone is an opioid (though different from Heroin, Oxy, etc.) it causes constipation. 

Due to Suboxone's opioid blocking effect, if pain medication were needed in a hospital emergency setting, there could be complications. If I came in to the ER with a broken arm and they gave me a shot of Morphine, it would do absolutely nothing. Though this hasn't been an issue for me yet.","I am a drug addict, and although I went to rehab to get off of opiate drugs I just couldn't seem to stop. So I went on Suboxone, which is a new alternative to Methadone treatment.

While Methadone is a normal agonist opioid ('agonist' means it gets use high) it can be dispensed to drug addicts to keep them from withdrawing from their drug of choice because the Methadone lasts so long. But Methadone must be taken every day at a clinic and cannot be taken home, addicts can STILL use drugs while on Methadone if they choose too, it is EXTREMELY difficult to get off of, and Methadone still gets users high.

Suboxone is a great alternative because it can be prescribed and bought at the pharmacy so you can take it at home, it takes care of your drug cravings but it doesn't get you high (not exactly, anyways, but it does satisfy the Opiate Receptors enough) and it's really not all THAT hard to get off of if you must (the withdrawals are are VERY manageable).", suboxone opiate withdrawal drug choice maintenance drug suboxone have heroin temptation take day avoid thing addiction take suboxone move life suboxone have life complaint suboxone opioid heroin etc constipation suboxone effect medication emergency be er arm shot morphine do nothing issue drug addict rehab get seem stop suboxone methadone treatment methadone opioid be drug keep drug choice methadone methadone be day be home use methadone get methadone suboxone be pharmacy take home care drug get satisfy opiate get

I don't know if it's just because of the methadone slowing your metabolism, or if it is caused by the need to eat sweets but I have gained at least 90 lbs since starting methadone 7 years ago.

I have taken such good care of my teeth, as far as self care and making sure I see the dentist every 6 months, and that still hasn't helped.  Has anyone else noticed this?

I have no side effects whatsoever. I have been through and still ongoing physical therapy ( 4th session 1 session is 3 weeks ) and been too four Orthopedic doctors and spinal specialists. My doctor and I discussed a long term pain application to get me off taking narcotics. I am no pro, but I know that opiates are the best for bad chronic pain, which i experience every day in my life. My doctor and I talked about Cymbalta which can be used to tone down the pain level sensors in the brain so I am not experiencing so much pain. I also have high levels of depression, and anxiety. Recently my Aunt and Uncle passed away which they practically raised me when I was born in Ireland, and my Sister's deaths was even more of a add on. I felt myself slipping into a deep black hole, and was looking for cheap thrills just to keep myself from going crazy ( literally ).

I was becoming anemic from the bleeding and other procedures to stop this were not very successful. I was about 45 at the time and was given the option to begin HRT. Over the years I have been given decreasing levels and am currently at .5mg. Even with the negative info regarding prolonged HRT, I opted to continue.  If you actually read the negative information, it was not related to estrogen, but rather to estrogen and progesterone in combination.

If people would take this drug as prescribed, there would not be as many problems and it wouldn't carry the stigma it does now.

I started having panic attacks when I turned 21, and the condition soon worsened into full-blown panic disorder. A year later, I couldn't hold down a job and was agoraphobic. I tried counseling and medications like Zoloft and Lexapro. The side effects from those made me feel worse than I did just not taking them.

Finally my doctor decided to put me on Alprazolam as-needed. 

It has been a life-saver for me. I would take the lowest dose (0.25 mg), and be able to leave my house for the first time in months. I visited friends, went to restaurants, and did everything I used to do before my disorder. I finally felt like I had my life back. I would take one whenever I anticipated a situation where I could have an attack, or when I felt one coming on already. Sometimes I didn't even need all of the 0.25 mg and could break it in half. 

Too many people abuse this medication by upping their dosage without a doctor's consent or using it when they don't need to, and now you are almost treated like a criminal at some pharmacies and doctor's offices when they learn you are taking it because they think you are a druggie.

I *much* prefer this medication over any of the SSRIs, which have horrible side effects. I felt like a zombie on those medications, had no sex drive at all, and didn't have any energy whatsoever. The doctors tell you those side effects will go away with use, but for days to even weeks you feel 10 times worse than you did before. It's just not worth it.

0.25 mg of Alprazolam as-needed for anxiety has helped me get my life back on track and really helped save me from spending days and nights locked away in my house. I highly recommend this medication for responsible people who just need something in a crutch and don't want to go on long-term SSRIs that leave you feeling drained and lifeless.

Yes, counseling and therapy are a better alternative to medication, but the problem is always finding a *good* counselor, and sometimes even then, they just don't work. I have seen 3 counselors and all of them have failed to help me with anything, all I did was waste a $20 copay each visit to have them tell me things that sounded like they came from an inspirational booklet.

I have not heard anything negative about the medication, except for the side effects of oily stools, etc. I believe the people who have experienced the bad side effects are people who are continuing to eat fatty foods (such as pizza, cheeseburgers, etc.) and continue to take the Orlistat. If you follow the directions, you are to eat low-fat and also take a multi-vitamin.

My epileptologist was hoping this would be the one. We added it on to what I was currently taking at the time (tegratol and dilantin) and crossed our fingers. Guess what? After reaching 400mg a day- I went from having 3-4 generalized seizures A WEEK, to 3 TOTAL in many many years! Unfortunately, I continued having partial complex seizures until we found the Dilantin/Lamictal/Topamax combo (in the last 3 years) and I still have 1 or 2 of those a month.  I really owe my life to topamax. AWESOME drug. Awesome awesome awesome.","In the beginning I remember getting ""topatingles"" or tingling in my fingers (that hurt sometimes), toes, and even my lips. I lost a lot of weight and have stayed in the underweight category ever since. My memory vanished (I affectionately nicknamed this drug ""stupimax"" and ""Dopamax""), I got strange aches and pains in my bones, joints, and muscles. I was more sensitive to the sun and heat and my sweat was reduced. I frequently had a runny nose and cough. Food tasted funny. Sex felt different (not bad- just different) my skin was  very sensitive to touch and my hearing was overactive. My potassium kept testing deficient and I had to be prescribed supplements. My hair also fell out in clumps!

All that went away or got better with some time. I also found out WHY it was happening- I was malnourished. Once I started drinking 56-80oz of water a day, taking a multivitamin + biotin (for the hair issue!), eating potassium rich foods and a more healthy diet all of a sudden the side effects started to vanish.

10,sotret,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,acne,"I took isotretinoin for persistent adult acne.  My skin was not by any means awful, but I did have evident pimples on my forehead and chin, and awful, awful blackheads on my nose that despite daily steaming and extraction, were terrible.  The drug totally cleared up my face, and my blackhead literally dried up in front of my eyes.  My once horribly oily skin changed to almost normal.","First, let me say that I didn't experience the awful side effects that some do with isotretinoin use.  I did turn very, very red around the perioral area and especially at the nasolabial folds.  My face felt as if I needed to peel it off and scratch deep down in the dermis.  In fact, that was my main complaint--the itchiness . . . and of course the dryness.  But the dryness was not nearly as bad as I expected.  For example, my lips never cracked.  However, I'm several years out from treatment , and I still have dry skin problems.  It's weird because my skin was always so oily and now it's dry.  But that could be attributed to normal aging.  Regardless, I've become a real connosiour of facial moisturizers.  My skin is also a little more sensitive post isotretinoin.  Tazorac one percent, which I used to slather on nightly like lotion, now sets me on fire if I dare to use the half percent version more than twice a week.

10,retin-a-micro,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,sun damage to face,"The prescription recommended that I use the gel every night, but this became too drying on my skin.  I alternate one night of Retin-A, 1 night of Stri-Vectin.  The Retin-A causes my face to peel, so exfoliating frequently is necessary so that I don't look as if my face has dandruff.  I use a Clarisonic for cleansing; it has been wonderful.  I have also used Benefit's ""Bluff Dust"" to cover the redness that the Retin-A gel causes, and continue to use Noritate for my rosacea.  The Retin-A is very effective, but also quite expensive.  I have found a pharmacy in Canada where I can order it online for less than 50% the US price.  I hope this doesn't make me sound unpatriotic!  I have always taken good care of my skin, and have no big wrinkles or droops --except for those lines between my eyebrows, because I am a committed scowler.  I do not believe that Retin-A would be as effective on skin that has already developed a good deal of sagging, but this is my personal opinion and is based only on my own experience.","Some of the information in this and the following paragraph will be redundant because when I started writing a response to the first question, I didn't see what was to follow.  The Retin-A gel dried my skin and caused it to peel.  For this reason, I used it every other day instead of every day. I alternate with Stri-Vectin.  I also need to exfoliate frequently or my face looks frightening!
When exfoliated and moisturized, my skin looks wonderful.  I have used Benefit Cosmetics' ""Bluff Puff"" to tone down the redness; I have stopped using any kind of makeup base if my face is shedding because foundation doesn't tolerate pieces of peeling skin very well.  However, my complexion looks great without makeup.  I still use mascara and liner and shadow.","Before going to bed, I wash my face with the Clarisonic brush.  I love it!
When my face is clean and dry, I apply a pea-sized amount of Retin-A gel all over my face and neck.  I do not avoid the eye area, but I do wash the gel off my eyebrows with a q-tip and water so that the skin under my eyebrows doesn't peel.  I also put Talika Lipocils on my eyelashes.  
In the morning I wash my face, exfoliating every couple of days to rid the skin surface of drying flakes.  Then I moisturize with shea butter or almond oil or even extra-virgin olive oil.  This does not make my face oily; my skin drinks up the oil and looks good.  
The following night I wash my face and when it is clean and dry, I apply Stri-Vectin.  I alternate so that one night I use Retin-A and the next night I use Stri-Vectin or another moisturizer.  I don't think I will be buying any more Stri-Vectin because I am doubtful of its effectiveness and because I would prefer to make my own product.  I know that I will be unable to make Retin-A gel, but making other products for my own use is very attractive to me.", prescription gel night skin alternate night night stri-vectin face peel look face use clarisonic have benefit bluff dust cover redness gel continue use noritate rosacea retin-a have pharmacy canada order % price hope make care skin scowler do believe retin-a be skin deal opinion experience information paragraph be response question see follow gel skin peel reason day day alternate stri-vectin exfoliate face skin have benefit puff tone redness kind makeup base face foundation tolerate complexion makeup use mascara liner shadow bed face brush love face amount gel face neck do avoid eye area wash gel water skin eyebrows peel morning wash face couple rid surface moisturize butter almond oil oil make face skin oil night face apply stri-vectin alternate night use retin-a night use stri-vectin moisturizer think be effectiveness prefer make product know be make gel use

9,topamax,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,depression/binge eating,"With the Topamax alone, and not myself consciously changing any of my dietary habits or exercising, I lost about 10% of my body weight in the first two months of treatment.

Not that food didn't taste good, or I wasn't hungry, I just filled up really quickly, and nothing seemed any more appealing than anything else. So when you're not just going off whatever looks yummy at that exact second and you actually stop and think about what you're about to eat, you tend to choose something a tad bit healthier and less caloric. Combine that with the fact that it would take about half the amount to fill me up, and there you have your weight loss.","Dry mouth (I was also taking Prozac at the time which definitely contributed), mild transient tingling in the hands and feet (pins and needles), I've read a lot of posts in forums online from people suffering memory problems with Topamax (i.e. dopamax), they forget words easily, have trouble spelling, feel foggy, etc... I guess I'm one of the few fortunate people whom Topamax doesn't effect that way. Either that, or the dose I'm at (200 mg) is well below my tolerance threshold. Many of the people in these forums were being treated for epilepsy and debilitating migraines and taking doses up to 1200mg.","I had done some research on Topamax online before it was even an approved treatment for migraines, and it was only FDA approved for epilepsy. While on the web I found that a surprising amount of doctors were prescribing it for off-label purposes, such as an add-on to an SSRI that wasn't working well enough in depressed patients, a mood stabilizer in patients with bipolar disorder, and (gasp!) a weight loss drug in obese patients and in those with binge eating disorder.

My eyes after nearly two months time turned red and never cleared up so the doctor dropped the alphagan p and replaced it with timilol 0.25 percent. The redness quickly went away. Now with azopt in each eye once in the morning and once at bedtime and timilol 0.25 in both in the mornings only my occular pressures have been reduced one to two points lower in each eye than what the cosopt did when taken in the morning and at bedtime. These changes have not stopped the hair loss from occuring even though timilol 0.25 percent has half the timilol in it as the cosopt and is used only once a day in each eye vs cosopts twice a day in each eye.

He told me I caught a sinus infection since the steroid lowers your emmmune system and makes it easier to catch another infection. He then prescribed me to 50 mg of Prednisone each day for a 3 day term so that it could tackle the inflammation fast so that the cortisone puffer would be able to catch up ( it couldn't work fast enough as it takes a while to start working) and also prescribed me to Amoxicillin for the sinus infection (since it was caused by bacteria) He said he would have prescribed me the antibiotic even if i didn't catch the sinus infection as an immune booster since prednisone lowers your immune system..

One minute I was clawing up the walls in pure mania, the next curled up in a fetal position on my bed contemplating suicdie. I am no longer at the whim of my moods and neither are those around me. I'm lucky that I started pharmaceuticals almost immediately after I was diagnosed a bipolar. Lamictal gives me amazing clarity to go about my day, honestly assess myself and form real relationships. Lamitcal lifted a fog, I guess you could call it. Now that I'm medicated I realize how cloudy my thought processes used to be. It's a wonderful feeling.

Interestingly, I hardly dreamt before beginning Lamictal. I would dream (I mean dream in the sense of being able to imagine pictures and scenes while asleep, not REM) maybe once every two months. Now I dream every night. I found that the closer I take it to bedtime the more frequent and more intense my dreams.","Drowsiness, a bit of mental numbness.

More than that and I feel numb. Some might call it drowsiness, but it's more a sluggishness of the mind for me.

Before I began treating my bipolar disorder, I used to write a fair amount of fiction. It sort of flowed from me. I definitely had the artist's temperament. After Lamictal, though, that inherent creativity fizzled out. It doesn't come spilling out of me while I'm deep into a manic euphoria. I have to work at art now.

It has been entirely weight-neutral, which was a big consideration for me. I had some very pleasant side effects when I first started taking the drug--vivid but enjoyable dreams and an increase in sexuality. The only negative effects were sometimes having to reach to find the word I was trying to use (which has since lessened, although it still happens occasionally) and pretty bad acne (which I am now treating separately and is much better.) Neither of those effects are on the PI sheet, and my doctor seems very skeptical that either was caused by the drug, but I've found lots of anecdotal evidence of other people experiencing similar things. Regardless, the effects have been minimal and WELL worth it considering how much I've been helped.","I started treatment when I was in what seemed like a mixed state--barely able to leave my bed at times, having to go into the bathroom at work to cry nearly every day, having strong urges to self-mutilate, and having a lot of suicidal ideation.

Lamotrigine started lifting the depression almost immediately, and once I hit the theraputic dose of 200 mg, it was like a cloud lifted overnight. I still have some ups and downs, but nothing major, and even when destructive thoughts cross my mind, I'm able to push them away more easily.

9,claritin,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,indoor allergies,"I recently saw my PCP for my annual exam and had 2 major concerns to discuss with her.  The first was some depression issues and the second was that I had recently developed indoor allergies.  As is standard my PCP recommended antidepressants and therapy for the depression and Claritin (24hr non-drowsy) for the allergies.  The problem is that I am nursing my son and no antidepressants are ""safe"" for nursing mothers (or rather, for our nursing children).  On the other hand, my MD approved Claritin although I was nursing.  At the end of the session she told to to start on Claritin and come back for the antidepressants once I weened my son.  So I started the Claritin and my depression abated.  All of my ""depressive"" symptoms were relieved (the inability to sleep at night but feelings of tiredness all day, the aches, the inability to concentrate...).  Since I started taking Claritin it was like a switch was flipped and the quality of my life has increased significantly.  I feel ""normal"" for the first time in a long time.  In terms of my allergies, the sneezing, runny nose and watery eyes have lessened but my red eye concern (the swelling and redness of the area surrounding my eyes) has not been relieved.  Regardless, I am happy with the product.

I share this in the hope that some scientist out there uses this information to help our elusive understanding of depression and its treatment.  Perhaps an alternative for postpartum depression?

Granted, it was after I stopped taking the medication that this ""cure"" took place, but I never experienced this with other anti-depressants. While taking it, Effexor made me so sleepy all the time that I slept a good deal more than normal (10-12 hours daily). This is why I stopped taking it. But when I did, I felt better than I had in years. I remained depression-free for about 3 years. I then dealt with depression again for about 8-10 months (I didn't want to lose another 6-8 weeks taking the Effexor ""cure"" so I delayed, hoping I would just ""snap out of it"" on my own). When I finally conceded this wasn't going to happen, I returned to my doctor, who then convinced me to try something new, so I tried Cymbalta, hoping to get Effexor's benefits, without the side-effects. It worked well as long as I used it, but when I stopped, there was no ""cure"" like I'd had with Effexor. Now I take 600-1000 mg of samE. It's not as good as the post-Effexor experience, but I feel less dependant on the medical system for my maintenance, and I focus on physical health (good food, exercise, vitamins)to maintain my emotional health. Those things alone, unfortunately, do not completely do it for me, and that's where the samE comes in. It makes the difference.","As indicated in the question relating to treatment benefits; the side effects of Effexor, for me, were a tendency to sleep a lot, and to feel sleepy much of the time.","I began Effexor under the care of a psychiatrist who was treating me for depression. My depression took the form of a lack of interest in all aspects of my life and I had begun to ""shut down"" to such a degree that sometimes the act of just walking from the garage into my house required a strong act of will. When I had to run errands, like grocery shopping, I felt an uncomfortable detachment from my environment. My treatment with Effexor, at worst, sometimes simply took me down (energy-wise) an additional notch from where I was. At best, it shifted me from the uncomfortable detached feeling and elevated my mood a couple of notches above where it had been. I had moments of feeling fully functional. That was enough to give me a sense of feeling better, and the will to decide to take my full energy back. That's when I stopped taking it, and experienced the miraculous ""cure"". If I ever experience such a deep depression again, I will choose to try the Effexor again (the original, not the newer version), rather than the Cymbalta. With the Cymbalta, I would already know that the benefits would only last as long as I chose to be on it, whereas, the Effexor would give me hope for a lengthy remission.", i cure medication cure place time deal dealt depression i want lose -8 effexor cure happen doctor try something cymbalta get effexor cure effexor experience feel dependant system maintenance focus health food exercise maintain health difference question treatment side effexor tendency sleep lot feel time care psychiatrist depression depression form lack interest life shut degree act garage house act run grocery shopping detachment environment treatment effexor energy-wise notch feeling couple give sense decide take energy cure experience depression choose try effexor version cymbalta cymbalta know chose be effexor give hope remission

I learned that the laser triggered the herpes outbreak, since the virus is in a dormant state until it is disturbed and activated by the laser.  I was prescribed 500 mg of Valtrex to be taken 3 days before the treatment, the day of the treatment and three days after the treatment, for a total of seven days.

9,tazorac,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"acne, photoaging","This is probably the best skin care product/medicine available. It is highly effective for both acne and photo-aging. It exfoliates the skin better than anything else, thus unclogging the pores. It also speeds up cell turnover, which reduces keratinization, preventing comedo-formation. It smooths out wrinkles, makes the deep layers of skin - dermis - thicker, increases collagen production, etc. You can read about all its benefits on PubMed. It has been proven more effective than tretinoin (Retin A) for both acne and photoaging.","Initially it is quite irritating, that is why it is VERY important to start using it less often and with a smaller applied amount. Do not overdose on Tazorac or else your skin - the upper horny layer, statum corneum - will become so thin and dry that it will crack - thus you will actually CREATE wrinkles rather than eliminate any. If you take it slowly and gradually increase the dose, you won't have that problem, as the skin adjusts to it. You should probably start using it only every 3rd or 4th day initially, gradually increasing to every other day or even every day. Some people are able to use it twice a day; I know I cant. In case you develop severe irritation, you must use a good moisturizer to prevent wrinkle formation. If you are using it for acne, and are using other products such as benzoyl peroxide - as you should, you should be even more careful, as skin irritation is cumulative from the various drugs. You will have to use a lower dose BP such as 2.5% because your skin will be exfoliated and more easily irritated.","The gel is more effective than the cream, in that it delivers a higher dosage of the medication faster. The cream however has lower side effects and it achieves more controlled release of the drug. I believe the cream is more appropriate for anti-aging, as it is more emollient. Neither the cream nor the gel are comedogenic so acne sufferers should not worry. I have used both the gel and the cream, with both concentrations - .05% and .1%. I am currently using the .1% cream.

The effects, compared to when I was in the episode I'm very stable. Occasional bouts of mild, often topical depression, but otherwise okay. 
As for insomnia, it's gotten to the point where I'm almost dependent on it to sleep.

From the hundreds of complaints I keep reading from other thyroid patients on the web, it appears that I am not alone in my dilemma, but to date, myself and the other hundreds of thyroid patients complaining of the same problem have yet to find a safe natural hair product to grow back hairloss from thyroid disease.

My previous thyroid doctor gave me an iodine uptake scan, took my bloodwork and diagnosed me with Hashimotos disease. Thyroid doctor said the best thing was to let my thyroid burn itself out and then he would put me on thyroid medicine, something I now feel was a mistake and should not have been done. Per my initial thyroid doctor, Hashimotos is sometimes hard to stabilize, thus, the Unithroid drug dosage I initially received .75 mcg had to be re-adjusted several times during the first year in order to stabilize my thyroid levels. Dosage was increased to 100 mcg. then to 125 mcg. then increased to 150 mcg. At some point, during these adjustments I went to another thyroid doctor who prescribed the T3 drug called Cytomel which gave me violent heart palpitations and I was taken off of this drug. The last Unithroid prescription dosage re-adustment I was given was for 150 mcg. 1xday 6 days wk with 1/2 dosage to be taken on Sundays. Medication to be taken on an empty stomach every morning. Last year, my body became Toxic to the Unithroid as I hadn't been to see the doctor in a while and had to be taken off the medication entirely for several days. Was restarted at a low dose of 50 mcg. because the toxicity had caused my pulse to race abnormally interupting my daily activities. This dosage was gradually increased I am now being treated with a Unithroid dosage of 125 mcg.

However, I do consume a fairly high amount of caffeine during the day and I was told to expect this by my doctor.  Another effect that I didn't really connect to the medication was a lack of motivation.  I did not attribute this specifically to the medication until I had a conversation with my best friend who had also taken Wellbutrin at one point.  She asked me specifically if I had experienced diminshed motivation while on the drug and it ""clicked"" with me.  I am not entirely certain if this can be attributed solely to the medication since this is also a symptom of depression.","Overall, I feel that my treatment with this drug has been successful.  I have not experienced any sexual side effects (which I know can occur with some antidepressants).  My libido is exactly the same as it was before my depression and before I began taking this drug.  I know that this drug can also cause a decrease in appetite as well as the urge to smoke.  My husband and I both smoke and I do smoke less when he is not home.  He is not on any medications and so he will frequently ask me if I want to go outside with him and smoke.  Usually (not always) I say yes for the companionship but sometimes I decline.  When he is not home I will smoke approximately 4 cigarettes in an 8-9 hour period (I used to be a pack-a-day smoker).

8,xanax,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,anxiety/depression,"I took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. It did work considerably in the beginning, however I would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. I would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. It did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably highger dosages then prescribed. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also, I've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself, I think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are VERY unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. Also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly, that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. Best of luck.","lethargy, loss of appetite.","I was started at .5mg, the second strength of dosage, 2 times daily.

Even with this diagnosis, the first endocrinologist did not suggest other treatments and I continued to suffer with excessive tiredness and memory problems.  I decided to go for a second opinion, and this endocrinologist told me that some individuals react better with a combination treatment of Levothyroxine and Cytomel.  This seemed to turn me around.  The memory and tiredness have gotten better, still not optimal.  It seems as long as one is �in the range�, doctors are hesitant to push the envelope.

I haven't had a mixed state or very rapid cycling since getting on it 2 years ago.  These symptoms continued to get more severe until I got on this drug.  Every episode was worse and lasted longer.  This drug gave me my life back.  I lost my job(s) and wound up in psychiatric inpatient care.  But I have become steadily better since first taking the drug.  I have to admit, to get to the point I'm at now took 2 years, but it's better then I was, and it's better than not getting better at all.  The longer I'm on Seroquel, the better I feel.  Also, I am able to sleep because of Seroquel.  At the worst when I went into the hospital I couldn't sleep at all which was making my episode even worse.  Sleeping drugs and benzodiazepines such as valium that were given to me made me feel horrible, very tired the next day, and even made me panic.  Anticonvulsants and even other psychotics gave me panic attacks, made me antsy or made me so tired I couldn't even function in day to day life.  Seroquel doesn't make me real tired, but it  has made a sleep schedule possible again.  I also don't feel too tired in the morning.","There are side effects of course, as there are with any drug.  I have a little more stomach troubles than what I started with but that could be due to the Lithium.  I have also had about 20 pounds of weight gain.  Before the seroquel I was thin with a high metabolism.  My weight is steady now, but at 20 lbs higher than it used to be.  I tried losing the weight but it has been impossible to get it off.  The drug doesn't make me groggy but I know some people on it that it just knocks out.","I have been on and off lithium and paxil for years.  I tried zyprexa, depakote Triliptal and Lamictal, but these made meunfunctionally tired or I had severe reactions to them.  I have a problem where drugs create severe reactions and sensitivity in me so dr.s give small amounts of several rather than a mega dose of one.  I tried Risperdal but it gave me severe panic attacks and restlessness.  I started out with an antipsychotic and lithium at the hospital to bring the mania and mixed states down.  Later I switched to seroquel and Paxil was added to help with my anxiety and depression.  I was on Seroquel at a lower dose than most 200mg to start, 900mg lithium (anymore than that makes me very sick even though the blood tests show it's within normal limits)and Paxil at 25mg.  Now 2 years later, as I am not in a severe episode I can get by on half the Paxil, 50 mg Seroquel and the lowest Lithium possible to keep it in treatment range.  I raise the doses if I have to (with permission of the Nurse practitioner)and I take 25-50mg Seroquel as needed throughout the day if I need to for anxiety, although I don't need to very often.

8,xanax,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,anxiety/depression,"I took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. It did work considerably in the beginning, however I would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. I would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. It did work considerably for anxiety, initially, but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably higher dosages then prescribed. In retrospect, I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates, because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also, I've found out that benzodiazepines, especially alprazolam can be very addictive, which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day, unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day, every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself, I think if you consider alprazolam at all, it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam, like buspar, which has no addiction potential, however, I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails, and there are VERY unpleasant side effects, which can be life-threatening. Also, alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly, then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly, that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks, and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed, have the dr. start you on .25mg., the lowest dose, and you should see a great difference in your anxiety, especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. Best of luck.","lethargy, loss of appetite.","I was started at .5mg, the second strength of dosage, 2 times daily.

Because the drug is very hard on tissue, you can't inject into the same area.  Upper arms are divided into 6 imaginary sections, abdomen 6 areas, legs 6 areas, and buttocks 6.  So inject into first arm area on one arm, then next injection opposite arm, then abdomen, legs, and buttocks.  Then you must start over in the first arm, but a different section and then work your way down again.  This keeps tissue necrosis from occuring.

So I will be explain how the drug works on me from a philosophical assessment.

Background:
I had taken Strattera for three years (2005-2007) where it helped control ADD where I had difficulty doing so. It helped me focus, stay organized, manage relations, and most or all of the benefits I listed prior. I dropped the drug for 3 years so that I may learn how to control my ADD without the help of medication. During those three years I gained remarkable self control in overcoming ADD. However, I got to the point where I couldn't win over ADD, which was losing focus randomly. During college lectures that I found very intriguing I would often zone out/space out when I could not have been more interested in what was being professed. The frustration of this led me to conclude that medical assistance was the best choice.

On the drug:
I read and understand that the (generally) biggest con--side effect--to this drug is that there is some sort of depressive or suicidal figure involved. From an evaluative standpoint of myself, I've concluded that my desire for happiness is lowered from where it was prior to the drug. In other words, if I felt a need for a happiness at a 9th strength before, I now had the need for happiness at a 5th strength. Since happiness, to me and most I'd say, is the driving force for existence in life, a lessened desire for it would lead to two results. Lessened feeling for the needing to exist/live and feeling less depressed (because I now do not need to be happy as much as before).

Understand that this drug does not control me, I control this drug. I suggest that while you take the medication you assert a greater self-awareness. As you examine how it affects you, you can understand when you are thinking naturally or by the drug.", focus commitment self-confidence goal organization memory thought expression thereof regard appear medication be explain drug assessment background strattera control add difficulty focus stay manage drug learn control add help medication self control add point win focus college zone out/space have frustration conclude assistance choice drug read understand con effect drug sort depressive figure standpoint desire happiness drug happiness strength need happiness strength happiness say force existence life desire lead feeling needing exist/live need be understand drug control control drug suggest medication self-awareness understand drug

8,seroquel-xr,Highly Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,bipolar ii,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder in February of 2009. I found that my manic states led to very erratic and inconsistent behavior. I also found the depressive lows to be particularly difficult to manage.

In November 2009 I was prescribed SEROQUEL by a Urgent Care Physician. Immediately I found its calming effects to be extremely relieving to my mania. I did, however, find it difficult to maintain a functioning state due to its sedating effects. I then switched to SEROQUEL XR and found a much more successful experience. I was initially given 400mg SEROQUEL XR paired with 10mg LEXAPRO. While initially a good way to stop the mania, I found 400mg to be too much to function on. I decided to halve my SEROQUEL XR dose to 200mg continuing to take 10mg of LEXAPRO. This combo has been great and I am so much calmer and feel way more in control of my life. I do, however, find the sedating effects to be difficult upon awaking in the morning. I try to offset this by ensuring that I receive a full 8-10 hour rest after administering a dosage. I would highly recommend this combo to anyone that is having difficulty finding a mental balance between dark and light. This year of treatment has allowed me to find a calm that I have never quite experienced beforehand.","I found that despite the great benefits mentally, the physical side effects are a fair trade.

8,effexor-xr,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"anxiety, mild depression","Venlafaxine is a bicyclic antidepressant, and is usually categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), but it has been referred to as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It works by blocking the transporter ""reuptake"" proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood, thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. The neurotransmitters affected are serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Additionally, in high doses it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine, with recent evidence showing that the norepinephrine transporter also transports some dopamine as well, implying that SNRIs may also increase dopamine transmission. This is because SNRIs work by inhibiting reuptake, i.e. preventing the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters from taking their respective neurotransmitters back to their storage vesicles for later use. If the norepinephrine transporter normally recycles some dopamine too, then SNRIs will also enhance dopaminergic transmission. Therefore, the antidepressant effects associated with increasing norepinephrine levels may also be partly or largely due to the concurrent increase in dopamine (particularly in the prefrontal cortex).",Difficulty in reaching orgasm. Increased amount of ejaculate. Rare mild headache.,"My uptake levels were not severely out of balance. I started with 150 mg and felt the positive effects in 20 minutes.

I found a doctor (psychiatrist)and he put me on Effexor.  It was a miracle.  I was soooo happy to find something that worked so well, and on the first try. (Several years before, I had gone through what my family refers to as the ""year of hell,"" when I first began the journey of searching for an anti-depressant that would work AND not have side effects that kept me from functioning normally.) My treatment consisted of: Taking the 300 mg of effexor, and monthly visits to my psychiatrist to determine how well my effexor was working and to discuss other treatment options. Although I could notice a marked difference in my mood, I still felt that I wasn't nearly as healthy mentally as I needed to be.  I would still have days when I felt ""paralyzed"" and very anxious.  When I discussed the problem with my psych., he suggested that I add Luvox, another anti-depressant, to my regimen.  That helped as well, although there were two unpleasant side effects: 1) loss of sex drive and difficulty achieving orgasm, and 2) night sweats.  My doc prescribed 1 mg of hytrin for the night sweats; it worked, and he recommended 60 mg. ginko biloba daily for the loss of sex drive.  It may have helped a little, but I was never quite sure. One other thing I found beneficial for my anxiety was 10 mg. dexadrine.  It seemed contradictory to me that a stimulant would calm me down, but the very first day I took it, I felt calm for the first time in my life. Up until then I didn't realize how severe my anxiety was, because I had never known what it was like to be without it. But that very first day I took it, I felt a calmness come over me that was such a relief.  Always before, I had a feeling inside that I can only explain as the feeling one would get if one was late for an important meeting with one's boss.  Sort of like, ""I'm late! Gotta hurry! oh, no!""  That was a feeling that I had always had, and it had nothing to do with what my situation was-- late or early, it made no difference.  For the first two weeks I took the Dexadrine, I didn't pull my hair (trichotillomania)at all, nor did I even realize I wasn't pulling, as I didn't even think about it.  Unfortunately, I did go back to pulling after that. The 2 side effects I experienced with the dex. is that 1) it made me drowsy for about the first hour after I took it, and 2) it made me feel like I lost my spontaneity.  I got a lot more done, and I didn't feel so panicked, but I wasn't as much fun.  For that reason, I stopped taking it regularly and took it maybe only half of the time.  After maybe a year or two I quit taking it altogether and when I went back on it last year after having been off of it for about 5 years, it no longer worked as it had before.  It made me feel jittery as though I'd had way too much coffee.  It just made the anxiety worse.

I'm not sure if I was supposed to tell about more than one medication for this survey. However, these four meds I've mentioned were all sort of intertwined, so it seemed appropriate for me to do so.

8,propecia,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,male pattern baldness,"Ostensibly this will halt or even reverse the effects of male-pattern baldness. So far, one month in, there is not a great deal to report. I expected my hair loss to temporarily increase, as I had read in the literature that as dormant hair follicles reactivate, they push dead hairs out in order to form new ones. In other word, hair in a dead follicle will linger for a few months, and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new. So far, this has not occurred. The product must be taken for up to two years for any noticeable hair growth to take place, so I really haven't been on it long enough to judge its re-growth potential. In terms of halting the process, however, I must say there are fewer hairs in my brush each morning, so it's possible the drug is having an effect already. I will post a fuller report in another forty-seven months, I suppose.","I was surprised to experience brief blinding headaches in the upper left rear quadrant of my head, like a mini seconds-long burst of pressure that felt like a blunt object suddenly trying to explode out of my skull.

The formulation I was prescribed was 1 milligram, although I believe the usual prescription is for 2 milligrams and can go as high as 5 milligrams.

It was affecting my job and family life. My migraine would start with a mild headache on the left side of my face and the pain would increase with time. Taking Relpax at the onset really helped to slow down the pain and in most cases stop it.,"The side effects were mild compared to the pain. Around 30 minutes after taking the pill, I would feel a little tired and sleepy.  However the feeling would not be so severe that I could not work or continue daily tasks.  This side effect would pass in about 1-2 hours.","At the onset of the headache, I would take a pill.  Some of my headaches would start at night, around 3:00AM and I would lay in bed hoping the pain would go away.  WRONG decision.  I quickly learned to take the pill as soon as I felt ANY sign of a headache, no matter what time of day or night.  If you don't take the pill at the onset of a headache, the pill will not be effective in stopping the pain and you will have to ride the headache out.  That could take a day to several days before the pain subsides.

8,niaspan,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,cholesterol problems,"My cholesterol levels were terrible.  I was around 32 years old with, as the doctor said, ""the cholesterol of a 40 year old man.""  It may have been partly due to my crohn's disease (which was flaring) and the weird way my body was absorbing nutrients at the time. Over the past 4 years my HDL levels have been significantly higher, and my overall cholesterol has moved into the acceptable zone (though not as good as I wish it was)!","Niaspan is a high dose of Niacin (vitamin B) and causes a good amount of flushing at a dose of 1000mg.  My cholesterol levels were screwy, and I had a more holistic doctor at the time.  She wanted to avoid drugs that she considered more harsh.  I was instructed to take the dose right before I went to bed.  I took the first dose about an hour before bed, and I turned beet red with the most amazing full-body flush.  Skin on my arms, torso, chest, neck and face was flushed.  I was really hot and really uncomfortable.  I went to lay down and try to sleep, but I couldn't get comfortable.  It was embarrassing because we had a guest staying with us at the time!  After about 15-20 minutes the flush subsided, and I was able to fall asleep.  So it is important to literally take the pill as you're getting into bed.  I've noticed some flushing sort of subconsciously while I'm asleep, but it generally doesn't wake me up.","I started with 1000mg and stayed at that level for about 2 years.  Then, after I moved and changed doctors, my dose was reduced to 500mg/night.

The doctor started on a higher course of the medicine, but the dose is currently 100mg (2 pills) every evening.  There was a significant reduction in Crohn's disease symptoms, particularly general intestinal cramping.  This was particularly helpful for cramping that tended to occur as I was relaxing to go to sleep.","Though the Crohn's disease in itself makes me tired, and I feel that the addition of the Mercaptopurine has added to my general fatigue.  The fatigue abated somewhat as the dose was lowered (the doctor started at a more aggressive dose).  I also seem to catch every bug that is going around.  By suppressing my immune system I believe the Mercaptopurine makes it easier for seasonal illnesses to set up shop.","I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease about eight years ago.  The doctor started with a series of Remicade and a prescription of Prednisone. This combination made it possible for me to eat again - hurray!  As for maintenance drugs, I have been on several, including Asacol and Pentasa.  There were probably others, but those are the two that I definitely remember.  It seemed as though my body would react well to a drug, but then the drug eventually lost that initial effectiveness. I have been on Mercaptopurine for 3-4 years now, and am getting ready to ask to move to a new drug.

My doctor prescribed me a 1mg tablet to take 2 of them in the morning and 2 at night at the onset of a cold sore.  It helped but the sore still ran its ugly course, even if I caught it right at the tingling point before it came out.  When I was 38, I went on birth control.  After about a year of being on Yaz, I began getting cold sores EVERY MONTH!  I told my doctor but she didn't think it was from the birth control - even though I read that BC suppresses your immune system, and anything that does that can allow for more instances of cold sores.  I went off the Yaz for 2 months, and STILL got cold sores during those two months.  So maybe she was right.  She then prescribed Valtrez 500mg once per day and I've been taking that since 9/09.  Still, like clockwork I get a cold sore every single month.  Either right before during or after my period.  So I think it's hormonal.  something is triggering them every month.  I've changed my diet completely, I take 4,000mg of Lsyine each day, I've tried the Red Marine Algae also.  No difference.  I'm a high stress personality anyway which doesn't help.

7,duragesic,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,severe chronic pain,"Extremely effective in reducing long-term, chronic pain (muskoskeltal and nerve), especially as a long-acting, baseline pain reducer in combination with a break-thru medication (I used Hydrocodone APAP and/or Percocet) for spikes in pain levels (due to falls, joint dislocations, broken bones, etc that cause temporary or short-term increases in pain.)","It is a very strong opioid, which is highly sedating, especially in combination with other drugs that can cause drowsiness. Even though I am very opioid-tolerant, it was still sedating for me.  In addition to causing drowsiness and fatigue, it tends to be highly habit-forming.  Because of the strength and nature of the drug, the human body becomes physically dependent on it, which has a few implications.  First, it loses efficacy over time, meaning you need to keep increasing the dosage over time to maintain the same effectiveness. The other issue with physical dependence is withdrawal.  I had severe physical withdrawal symptoms if I waited too long to change the patch (starting a day or so after I was scheduled to change it and becoming more and more severe with time.)  Several specialists I saw actually recommended hospitalization for controlled dose reduction as the safest way to stop taking fentanyl patches because they cause such severe physical withdrawal symptoms.  I withdrew from it completely 3 times, and suffered severe, debilitating symptoms for the first couple of weeks each time with decreasingly severe symptoms lasting for over a month after I stopped using it.  Although I have never had an issue with psychological dependence on any drug, I think it is important to mention that this one can be very addictive (meaning that those who take it frequently develop a psychological dependence, especially if the user is prone to substance abuse.)","I took Duragesic as a long-term maintenance medication on several different occasions, but it can be taken permanently as long as it remains effective.", pain nerve baseline pain reducer combination medication i hydrocodone apap percocet pain falls cause pain opioid combination cause drowsiness addition drowsiness fatigue be strength nature drug body efficacy time meaning keep dosage time maintain effectiveness issue dependence withdrawal withdrawal change patch day change time hospitalization reduction way stop withdrawal withdrew debilitating couple time month issue dependence drug mention be develop dependence user substance abuse maintenance medication be

My case probably isn't a perfect control because I lost a high paying job, moved to another state, and moved in with my girlfriend when I began taking the medication.  Within 4 months, started a brand new job and encountered other new stressors.  

I can attribute some of the loss of libido to job related stress and moving in with my girlfriend of 5 years.  I would guess the effects on libido would be very minimal had my job and living situations remained constant.

I'm overall much happier having thicker hair than I would be with a consistent sex drive.  I am able to get more work done and focus more on important life goals than being constantly distracted with sex.  Instead of wanting sex 5 times per week, I only want it twice per month now.  Again, this is probably a plus","I started slowing losing hair when I was 23-24.  The hair loss was unnoticeable until I turned 27.  My receding hairline started to become very apparent at 27, especially in my part line.  I began taking propecia when I turned 28 and it appears to have regrown hair on the back and sides of my scalp and has slowed my receding hairline.  Unfortunately, it appears that I am still developing a minor bald spot in the middle of my scalp.  

Based on my current rate of hair loss, I'm guessing that I will maintain a healthy head of hair for the next 4-5 years.  At 35, I probably won't care how my hair looks because I'll be well out of the dating game.  

I don't think Propecia is a cure-all for my particular pattern of baldness, but I feel it would be highly effective for others.  Anyone who is experiencing baldness at the back of scalp would benefit greatly.  The receding hairline will probably continue, but at a much slower pace.

7,zoloft,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,depression,"Our home was destroyed in the 1994 Northridge Earthquake. Before the earthquake, I was already experiencing depressive symptoms but was reluctant to take medication for it. After the earthquake, my doctor recommended I give the antidepressants a try for a few months coupled with therapy to get me back on track. About two weeks later, I found myself feeling good again, (in spite of my therapist telling me how screwed up my family was) driving down the freeway, singing at the top of my lungs and playing air drums on the steering wheel of my car. The ""Old me"" was back! 

Thanks to the medication, I was able to re-organize my life and focus on moving ahead instead of being stuck knowing what things needed to be done but not having the drive or motivation to do them.","The sexual side effects ultimately led me stop taking the Zoloft. My husband and I found it very frustrating that I was unable to reach climax where before, I had been multi-orgasmic. Because our sex life is very important to us, this became an area of contention that I found to be unacceptable.  My inability to reach orgasm was demoralizing for my husband feeling he could no longer please me and for me the frustration of it all made sex seem like too much work to bother with. My libido came to a screeching halt. This depressed both of us so I gradually weaned myself off the Zoloft and shortly thereafter, became pregnant with our first child. 

One other thing about taking the Zoloft was that after the elevated mood from the initial breakthrough of depression wore off; I found myself living life somewhere in the middle. In addition to the lows no longer being depressingly low, the highs were not as uplifting as before. I was, in essence, comfortably numb.

Other side effects were dry mouth, nausea, weight gain, and increased irritability. , although the later could have been due to the stress of our temporary living conditions.","My primary care physician prescribed counseling and the antidepressant, Zoloft. The plan was to take the medication for three to six months until I felt I was back on track and could maintain a functional lifestyle without it. 

I started with 25 mg every other day for five days, then 25 mg a day for one week, followed by 50 mg a day every day thereafter. I began therapy with a psychologist once a week where I was diagnosed with PTSD. Strangely enough, I found the counseling to do more harm than good in this case partially because it made me see my childhood for what it really was. I did not find that to be helpful at the time. Had I not been on anti-depressants before I went to counseling, I would have needed it afterward to deal with the emotional blows that I had to face and could no longer ignore that drove me into depression in the first place.", home earthquake earthquake take medication earthquake doctor therapy get track spite therapist family freeway singing top air wheel car medication re-organize life focus be drive motivation do side stop zoloft husband reach climax before sex life area contention be inability reach orgasm husband feeling please frustration sex work bother libido halt zoloft child thing zoloft mood breakthrough depression life middle addition essence side mouth nausea gain irritability later have stress living care counseling zoloft plan take medication felt track maintain lifestyle mg day day week day day therapy psychologist week ptsd counseling do harm case see childhood find be time have deal face ignore drove depression place

7,paxil,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,depression,"Helped me to feel better.  Lessened anxiety, panic attacks, tension, emotional exhaustion.  I was able to tolerate being around people better because talking did not seem so loud. Once I was used to the drug, it helped me get out of bed and function in day to day life better (falling asleep & getting out of bed was a serious struggle).  Eventually with the combined therapy, I pretty much now feel like myself again, just with less energy reserve and ability to have discipline with my routine.  (For instance, I can't get up early, during the 5am, 6am hours and get to work on time like I use to.  In fact I'm late for everything now which is out of my character) Can' tolerate multiple loads of stress with calmness and collectivity like I use to.  Otherwise day to day life is manageble as long as I obey my bodies new limitations.
I didn't gain weight or increase in appetite.  I struggled with appetite actually and at times had to force myself to eat.","This drug gave me alot of strange sensations.  When I turned my head left or right, I got this mild scratchy or whip like noise in my ears along with a tingling in my head; also my vision seemed to briefly black out.  This lasted for many months. I thought it was perhaps not real or just in my head. My psychiatrist called it ""tracking"" and confirmed it as a known side affect with paxil use.  I didn't bother to worry anymore about it.  This passed after some months.  I no longer get it.  I felt very dizzy and sleepy at times.  I'd fall asleep anywhere.  I don't know if it was the depression, the paxil, lack of sleep, my body trying to heal from stress.  Sometimes I felt like I was living life from inside of a fish bowl (from sensory standpoint). I was chronically late to my job of 8 years for 2 years straight after suffering this nervous breakdown (due to spousal abuse).  Subsequently, I was fired.
When I miss doses of the paxil, especially 2 or more in a row, I feel like I did when I just started them.  I can barely get out of bed and function.  I'm super sleepy.  I feel drunk.  I'm dizzy.

Hopefully this ""clean bill of health"" will continue as I begin year 3 of tamoxifen in my 5 year plan. The benefits of effexor help balance the mood swings caused by a lowered amount of estrogen in my body. Tamoxifen does its job by keeping the estrogen blocked in my body so any abnormal cells can't feed on the estrogen. My cancer was highly estrogen-positive. Lowered estrogen causes depression and mood swings. Effexor helps to alleviate these symptoms along with my exercise regime and healthy eating habits.","Side effects were more severe at the onset of taking tamoxifen. I had hot flashes that were quite severe. They often came without warning especially at mealtime. I also had some body aches and pains. Vaginal dryness was also severe. My period became erratic. After 2 years most side effects have decreased - hot flashes are gone as well as the aches. My period has been non-existant for 4 months. However, I feel irritable and edgy about the regularly scheduled time for a few days. The effexor helps. Dryness is still a problem but not as severe.

I did try a natural regime of vitamins (B-12 and E) for several months but I felt no relief. Friends even told me about my mood. I went from depressed to angry in a flash.

6,warfarin,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,heart condition,"Taking 3 mg of warfarin sufficiently thinned my blood so that I did not find it difficult to do everyday tasks.  I immediately felt better after I started the regimen in the spring of 2003.  My cough went away and I had a lot more energy.
I took this regimen for about 3 years, everyday.  I also found it easier to concentrate and think (what was I doing before it???)  It was as if my brain cleared up or something.  I breathed easier and I was more willing to tackle regular household chores.  I worked over 50 hours/week before and during this treatment.","The side effects of warfarin on me did not become apparent until a couple of years later.  I started feeling weak and I bruised easily.  I acquired more broken blood vessels/capillaries veins in my feet and calves.  I was tired and started feeling cranky.  I stopped taking warfarin for 6 months but then went back to it after I had the old feeling of ""thick"" blood.  During the 6 months that I wasn't taking warfarin, I felt better, had more energy.  But then the downside: my blood was getting too thick and I was starting to get headaches.  So I went back on it.  This time my doctor said I might have to increase dosage to 4 mg. since I hadn't been taking the warfarin.  However, when I had my thrombin checked, I was okay at 3 mg.; I took this for another 3 months and then started feeling the old way and quit again.  The same scenario was repeated (started feeling like I had ""thick"" blood and now I had increasingly bad headaches).  I went back on 3 mg. of warfarin in August of this year but only took them for 3 months. Then I started a vitamin/mineral/COQ10 regimen and stuck with it and am still doing that.  I credit most of the perfect blood feeling (for lack of a better term) to Vitamin E and the fact that I also changed my diet.  I try to eat a lot of veggies and fruits, and I have been a vegetarian for almost two years (not super strict - but I feel disgusted about eating meat and therefore never eat it unless it is buried in some food.  I do eat salmon and tuna.  The final straw for me with warfarin was that I started feeling really mad about things.  The littlest things would make me angry, anger that was way out of proportion to the incident.   When my teenaged daughter started crying after I ripped into her for staying longer at a social visit, and I heard my words echoing in my house, I knew that was it.  I quit warfarin and started taking 81 mg. of aspirin daily (I had a headache every morning after I went off warfarin).  I started the vit./min. regimen in November, gradually adding supplements as I learned about their benefits, but it wasn't until 3-4 weeks ago that I realized I wasn't having any headaches and I was able to stop taking 81 mg. of aspirin. Also, since starting the stricter diet and the vit./min. supplements (also some herbs), I have not had an anger ""fit"" (of course, I am also more prone to control my anger because I really didn't like how I had been), I do not feel depressed.  I have told everyone in my family about this because it seems so remarkable.  Why didn't the doctors tell me?","Treatment consisted of simply taking 3 mg. of warfarin daily and getting my blood thrombin checked every two months.  I was not a very good patient about getting my blood thr. checked so I'm sure when I was feeling weak and bruised/bled so easily, my blood was getting too thin.  And then when I would quit the warfarin for several weeks, sometimes months at a time, my blood would get too thick.  I really like my doctor though, because he tells me to do what makes me feel best, and I think that's smart advice.  I must say add that I always loved the feeling of donating blood before I took warfarin because it gave me the same feeling as I initially had with warfarin (at the very beginning of my treatment).  I would like to donate blood now but they don't let me because I don't weigh enough (which makes no sense at all).  Couldn't they take less blood?

The worst part was withdrawal following treatment.  It took at least 6 months of extremely gradual tapering off to withdraw, and I was on a low dose.  Any attempt to withdraw faster would produce chaotic mood swings from hysterical laughter to violent, yelling rages.  Every emotion, however mild, was magnified exponentially.  Sexual sensation also went off the scale with such hypersensitivity that ejaculations happened spontaneously without any physical stimulation - a sneeze or a yawning stretch would morph into an immediate ejaculating orgasm without any erection.

I was constantly anxious and scared and the rivotril made it possible for me to come down to relatively normal anxiety levels in ""safe"" situations, whereas before I didn't have any situations I considered safe.  It helped me sleep and made me feel more rested and in control.  I got pregnant while taking it (I had been trying for 18 years) and I honestly believe that being more relaxed helped me not only to get pregnant but to carry the baby as I had had four miscarraiges previously.  I started confronting situations that were uncomfortable to me before and was able to live a reasonably normal life, even though I have become housebound.  I feel the rivotril got me through a very tough time in my life.","The Rivotril didn't have any side effects in the long run, it made me a bit sluggish at first.  However after taking it for a few years and feeling I no longer needed it, I found it impossible to stop taking it as the withdrawal symptoms were so bad.  I have cut the dosage down considerably, from 5 mg at night to one, then I became nervous again and started taking 2 again.  I have tried several times to come off the drug completely but the results have been tremors and feeling sick along with high anxiety to the point of hardly being able to speak.  I would always go back on it.  I never felt I needed MORE...I just coudn't stop taking even a small amount.","I was told that panic attacks were caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain in the same area that caused epileptic fits.  As Rivotril is a sedative and is given to people with epilepsy they had found that it also helped alleviate panic attacks.  I was prescribed it for this reason.  I am unable to take anti-depressants which also stop panic attacks because of strong side effects so this was a better choice for me at the time.

I feel that it did the job, but had I known I would be on it for the rest of my life I'm not sure I would have started taking it.  But maybe if I was desperate like I was then I would.  I was concerned about taking it while pregnant but my child was normal.  She did have bad withdrawal symptoms though after I stopped breast feeding her.  No one realized that was what was happening when she cried all the time for seemingly no reason.  Back then it was unknown that going off the drug caused withdrawal as the drug had never been used short term.  Only for epileptics for life.  She is 13 now and perfectly normal.

No need to get up during night to void, also fantastic.","Excessive daytime sleepiness, difficulty concentrating and retaining information, craving sweets which worsen my hypoglycemia, among others.","Initial 300mg was taken for only 2 days, due to severe daytime sleepiness in AM.  Found it nearly impossible to drag myself out of bed in am.  My morphine controlled release wears off within 8-9 hours, so staying in bed NOT advisable without another dose of morphine or Percocet, but the neurontin makes me want to keep sleeping.  When I finally do wake up, minimally after 11 hours after I fell asleep, I still felt tired, and now in a lot of back, hip and sometimes even knee pain, from laying in bed motionless for so long, on L side of body.  Because of the sleepiness side effect, I do not take any during day. Since my MD would not lower dosage from 300mg until next monthly visit, I bought empty size 0 gel capsules at local health food store, and painstakingly divided the dosage from the 300mg capsules into 2 150mg capsules.  Initially, this seemed to be a good solution.  I was able to continue having 8h of pain-free sleep, and getting up after 8h was easier.   But, after only 4 days at the lower 150mg dosage, the excessive sleepiness after 8h of normal sleep continued, so I need to try cutting down the dosage even more.  Have to take the dextroamphetamine controlled release, to fully wake me up in AM, and once that wore off after 12 hours in early evening, I am too tired to study for my classes.  Overall, I would recommend this drug only for adults who do not have to drive to work, or adults who can take naps during work hours, or adults who are not trying to taking classes for credit.  I am hoping the upcoming RFA procedure will allow me to stop taking the narcotics and neurontin, and allow me to be able to work, study and retain what I learn in class (especially short term memory).", ability sleep pain need get night void daytime sleepiness difficulty information hypoglycemia mg sleepiness drag bed morphine release bed dose morphine percocet neurontin want keep sleeping wake lot hip knee pain bed motionless side body side effect take day md lower dosage mg visit size gel health food store dosage mg mg be solution continue sleep mg dosage sleepiness need try dosage have take dextroamphetamine release wake evening study recommend drug have drive work take work credit rfa procedure allow stop neurontin allow be work study retain learn class term memory

5,wellbutrin,Moderately Effective,No Side Effects,depression,"I have a long history in taking anti-depressant drugs.  It started in high school with prozac and desipramine, neither of which I have anything positive to report.  In college, after a dangerous stint without treatment, it resumed with luvox, and  later it was effexor.  Finally, after the scariest bout of all, leading to a stay in the hospital, they put me on wellbutrin.  Combined with rigorous therapy, dbt (dialectical behavioral therapy) groups, and much personal work, I got my head above water.  I was able to work, eat well and exercise regularly, but many of the symptoms were still there.  I thought that was the extent of what an anti-depressant could do for me, the rest of the work was up to me and maybe in about 20 years I might be able to feel happiness.  Since then I went off wellbutrin during a cross-country move, was part of a study for treatment resistant depression where it was recommended I try cymbalta.  I feel the cymbalta has actually influenced my negative thinking and given me more energy.  So now I know that an anti-depressant can potentially create better results than just keeping ones head above water.","None of the previous meds I mentioned, however did a damn thing but cause me to shake, be continuously thirsty and not be able to achieve orgasm.  The wellbutrin was great in that it didn't cause any sexual side effects.  That was a relief.  The ability to reach orgasm seems as if it should me a basic right for every human being, and the emptiness that replaces the disappearance of the bodies biological ability to feel good, just doesn't seem right.  I was very adament in telling my psychiatrist that I didn't want anything that caused sexual side effects, which most anti-depressants do.  The cymbalta causes the ""emptiness""  but honestly, the improvement it has made in my mood and productivity make it worth it for now.  Plus, I'm not in a meaningfully intimate relationship at the moment.  It seems to only cause and inability to reach inner orgasm however.  Clitoral orgasm is still possible with vibrator and not a human being.   Recently they have added a dose of wellbutrin to my regimen as an attempt to counteract the sexual side effect caused by the cymbalta.  I do not yet know if this is working (Like I said, I have no boyfriend so I don't even know why I'm bothering.  Really I did it to see if the addition of wellbutrin would make me feel even better.

My sciatica was not a condition that flared up continually; rather, it came approximately 4-6 times per month.","Excessive sleepiness, lack of concentration, feelings similar to those that one would experience taking oxycodone.  I felt ""high"" for many hours after taking this drug.","The plan was a permanent solution to my occasional flare-ups of sciatica.  My physician basically stated that there was no cure for my pain; therefore, I needed to be placed on a prescription regimen that would hopefully reduce the occurrence and/or frequency of sciatica.  Each bottle contained a 60 day supply with enough refills to last me an entire year.  I have 2 herniated discs, one at L4-L5 and the other at S1.  The herniation at L4-L5 was causing pressure on my sciatic nerve which runs down the length of the left leg.  For me, this drug was not effective; perhaps, if I had continual pain I would learn to live with the side-effects.  I did stop taking any medications for my condition and am learning to cope without prescriptions at this time.

5,botox,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,for wrinkle (line) reduction,"Botox was administered to help reduce the lines appearing on my forehead and at the outer side of my eyes- crows feet.  The 100 and 50 unit injections were effective in reducing the lines for a period of about 5 months, but there were noticeable adverse reactions with the 100 units.  The 50 units were as effective but without the spasms noted under Treatment Details.  OF the 2 times 50 units were injected,  the last time the botox had been reconstituted for more than the recommended 4 hours.  There was concern of effectiveness, but actually it seems as though the botox was more quickly effective, and seemed more effective in reducing the lines that the previous 50 unit injection.  More detail is covered under the treatment details.","Side effects were twitching of eyes, especially upon smiling,,, spasms of cheeks.  Blurry vision.  This lasted for approximately 3 days.","The first use of botox was 100 units. Injections were 5 injections on the upper-mid forehead. 3 injections were given around the outer side of each eye. Within 2 hours it was difficult to close my eyes.  The forehead was totally stiff. Upon smiling and talking my cheek muscles were noticably twitching.  Eye lids twitched, friends noticed my face spasming.
   I make note of this issue because of the fact concerning the stability of the botox.  I realize that botox is available in 50 or 100 unit vials, which are then reconstituted. The nurse stated that he had to use all of the botox (apparently he only had the 100unit vial)because it would be instable after 4 hours.    
   Since this time, I have had 50units of botox at two different times, injected in the same areas stated above.  There was no adverse spasms, be definite ""freezing"" of the forehead muscles.  The 100 units and 50 units lasted about 4-5 months before lines started to appear again due to frowning, smiling, etc.   I recently had only 10 units injected mid-upper forehead in 2-3 injections. Upon raising my eyebrows I needed (I thought) injections more lower mid section since the upper forehead did not move.  After one month, I find that I have a few lines above my eyebrow but in general, my forehead is less lined.
  My MAIN CONCERN is :  if physicians, agents  have only 50 - 100unit vials available, and they are only injecting 1 client, what do they do with the residual.  Is this why there is such a high cost  $11 - $15 per unit??  It makes me wonder if physicians are freezing or using the botox beyond the 4 hour expiration time.  Have manufacturers ever thought of packaging smaller unit packages to assure clients are getting ""the real"" stuff.  This last physician did not have the manufacturer's bottle for me to see, only a small syringe already pre-filled.", botox help reduce forehead side unit period spasms treatment time botox concern effectiveness botox unit injection detail treatment side cheeks blurry vision use botox forehead side eye close forehead cheek eye face spasming make note issue fact stability botox realize botox unit nurse use botox unit vial be time have botox spasms be appear etc forehead mid section forehead move month eyebrow forehead concern unit client do residual cost unit wonder botox hour expiration time unit assure stuff physician have manufacturer bottle see syringe

She was completely weaned off of Carbatrol at one point and went almost 8 weeks with no seizure activity.  She also went 5-1/2 months with no seizure activity with Keppra before having a tonic clonic seizure.  Due to her history of seizures (started at the age of 14 a couple of months after she started her period), and the ability to go for long periods of time without problems, we wonder if she is having extreme spikes in estrogen when she ovulates from time to time.

5,lexapro,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,depression and generalized anxiety,"I sought treatment for two problems in my life: my temper with my daughter and my lack of motivation.  This drug really helped me to control my temper.  In fact, the temper became nonexistent.  I used to yell a lot and stopped completely within two weeks of being on this medication.  However, this was the only benefit I experienced.","I gained 15 pounds, which my doctor swears was not related to the medication.  BUT - I have always struggled to GAIN weight - I weighed 95 pounds in college and finally got up to a healthy 115 with a lot of hard work.  In just the two months of being on Lexapro, I went up to 130.  Not being able to fit into any of my clothes during summer is NOT helping my depression.

Immediately upon beginning to take Lexapro, I felt ""high"" for about two weeks.  My doctor says ""that shouldn't happen because of the medication.""  Well, I wasn't doing any other drugs, so I don't know what to tell you there.

Possibly the worst side effect I experienced was a DECREASE in motivation.  If you read above, you may have noticed that one of the two reasons I sought treatment was to increase my motivation.  I had a hard time keeping my house clean and getting started on tasks.  Well, within two weeks of starting this medication, I began needing long naps (3+ hours) every day just to function.  I watched TV for the rest of the day.  I had no interest in work and basically messed around all day instead of working.  It was a severe decrease in motivation.

Also, I had no sex drive and was unable to orgasm.","I missed an appointment with my doctor and was not able to get a refill, so I have been off the Lexapro for a week.  In that time, I no longer needed to take naps and although I still procrastinate, it's back to the ""pre-Lexapro"" levels of procrastination, not the terrible levels I experienced while on the drug.  My temper did come back, though.  The withdrawals caused me to be so nauseous that I began throwing up and have had migraines ever since I stopped taking it.

From the moment I started taking it, it wasn't a decreased sex drive, I had none at all, which made the birth control completely useless to me. In addition to that, the acne just kept getting worse, I didn't have acne to begin with besides the occasional blemish here and there. It started getting worse on my face, then my chest, then my back, (it's not just one here or one there, my back, chest, and chin are seriously covered) I've even had one on my ribs! Crazy! My boobs no longer fit into my bras, even some shirts. It was like they doubled in size overnight (not a huge problem, just annoying with no explanation). I went out and bought a bra, a week later it didn't even cover my boobs. Lastly, I've been fretting the last 2 weeks because I still haven't gotten my period! I never had a problem with my periods showing up in the past, they've always been lighter and not very long, pretty ideal actually. The Dr. said I would bleed between... still not bleeding! I've taken 3 pregnancy tests, wasted 10 bucks on each! Oh yeah, I've been crying for no reason at all the last month. I started crying over some lady I didn't even know at work. I do not recommend taking Seasonique. I know it must be expensive although I don't know how much because my Dr. gave me sample packs and I'm not going to bother refilling it. Also they give you a coupon for $50 off and $25 off the next refill, if they are giving that much off it must be a lot. It wasn't terrible, just nothing was expected (and I still have no clue as to why I haven't gotten a period yet). I've tried several other birth control pills and never had any side effects with any of them. This is the first time I tried one where I only get a period every three months so maybe those are way different or something.

Taken twice per day was most effective, but side effects precluded that dosage for this patient(see below).

In the evening, however, (when the second pill was due to be taken, but wasn't), and especially if patient had an alcoholic beverage, the urge to smoke returned  with a vengence, though a few puffs were all it took to kill the urge.  When patient stopped taking Chantix (after a year of use), the urge for nicotine returned.","The side effects for patient were 1) an upset stomach directly after taking pill, and 2) VERY disturbing and vivid dreams.  Patient found that, regarding the stomach upset, it was less important to have food in your stomach before taking the pill (stomach still got upset), than to actually take the pill in the midst of eating, (i.e. eat some food, take the pill, then eat some more).  This method of taking the pill virtually eliminated the stomach upset problem.  As to the vivid dreams, that is why the patient only took one pill in the morning and did not take the pill in the evening.  Although patient still occasionally had vivid dreams, the incidence was far less often than when taking the pill twice per day.","Chantix was prescribed per the guidelines noted by the manufacturer.  As noted above, the dosage was altered by the patient to alleviate negative side effects.  Although a stop-smoking plan was packaged with the initial prescription, the patient stopped participating in the follow up due to the lack of urges for cigarettes.

We then began to take it at breakfast with as many dairy products as we could - yoghurt, cheese, milk on cereal etc, and the symptoms subsided.  The pain ceased after a couple of days but we continued to have violent, liquid bowel movements for another week...

4,sulindac,Marginally Effective,Moderate Side Effects,baker's cysts behind both knees,"After about a week, I started to see a small reduction in the size of the fluid-filled cysts behind my knees.  Over the 3-week treatment period, there was about a 25 percent reduction in the size of the cysts. There was also a mild reduction in the pain associated with the cysts. 

Another benefit was that I did not get upper GI pain & bleeding with this med, whereas NSAIDs had been causing black stools due to GI irritation & bleeding.","Within about 30 minutes of taking each dose of Sulindac, I experienced a colicky pain under my ribs on the right side.  The pain was not extreme, but it was noticeable and unpleasant.  Duration lasted 2 - 4 hours each time.  This side effect persisted throughout the entire treatment period.","Due to longstanding knee osteoarthritis, I am prone to fluid-filled cysts on the backside of my knees.  The cysts cause pain, swelling, and reduced circulation to the lower leg.  The cysts interfere with walking gait as well.

In past I had used NSAIDs to reduce the inflammation of these cysts, however due to NSAID-related side effects, this class of drug was put off-limits by my physician.  His recommendation was that I try a drug in the pro-NSAID class, which is less irritating to the stomach.

In retrospect, I think that for me, the Sulindac was a trade-off: less stomach irritation exchanged for liver irritation with the Sulindac.  Due to this side-effect, my doctor reduced frequency of medication to once per day.  My response to the Sulindac was less robust than I had hoped for -- much less improvement than I had experienced previously with NSAIDs -- and it also took a long time (3 weeks) to reach the level of improvement that in past I would achieve in 3 days with OTC NSAIDs.", week see reduction size treatment period percent reduction size reduction pain benefit get gi pain bleeding gi irritation bleeding dose sulindac pain ribs side pain duration time side effect treatment period knee osteoarthritis prone backside pain swelling circulation leg gait reduce inflammation side class drug physician recommendation drug class stomach sulindac trade-off irritation irritation sulindac doctor frequency medication day response sulindac improvement time reach level improvement past achieve

-increased mobility/ activity level due to experiencing less pain
- sleep ( was able to sleep longer while the medication was still active)
- better mood (because of less pain)","The level of pain control quickly decreased (with the prescribed amount of medication(10 mg)) resulting in having to steadily increase the dosage for the same amount of pain relief. However the worst side effects were severe constipation(even while taking stool softeners/extra fiber, water, etc), depression, insomnia, weight loss, hair loss, muscle wasting, my skin became completely dehydrated and wrinkled. Became physically and mentally addicted to the medication, when I tried to reduce the dosage /stop taking the medication I experienced severe withdrawal symptoms (fever,chills, nausea, vomiting, severe bone muscle and joint pain) to name a few.","I was in an MVA in 2002 in which I suffered a whiplash type injury which caused/accelerated the DDD. I was prescribed Percocette 5mg on an as needed basis for pain control. After 3 years (of constant agonizing pain)of being on the Percocette they became ineffective at relieving pain and I was referred to a PAIN CLINIC specializing in chronic pain. The doctors there decided that I had built up a tolerance/dependence on the Percocette and that it would be best to put me on a longer acting narcotic (Oxycontin 10mg,time released, supposed to provide pain relief for 12 hrs) with Percocette (Oxycodone 5mg/Acetaminophen 325 mg)for break through pain. In the beginning the medication seemed to help but over time I built up a tolerance to the Oxycodone(they became less effective) which meant I had to keep increasing the dosage to get the same amount of pain relief. For example I started out with Oxycontin 10mg/3x day and approx 3 Percocette/daily a couple of months later as my tolerance increased I had to take Oxycontin 20mg/3X day and 5-6 Percocette as the months passed by my tolerance grew and my dosage was increased. After about 8 months on the Oxycontin I started to experience all of the side effects mentioned above, not only did I notice the negative effects the drug was having on me but friends and family noticed too, and mentioned (not to me but amongst themselves) that my appearance/demeanor over the past 2 yrs had dramatically changed. A couple of months ago my Sister took me aside and asked me what was wrong to which I replied nothing why? She then explained to me how my behavior(depression, moodiness, etc.) and appearance(drastic weight loss) had been getting worse and worse and told me that she was worried. Being under the influence of these drugs for so long I felt like I was in a fog and really had no idea as to the extent of how bad it really was/ how I looked. So I stepped back and examined the last 4-5 yrs of my life while on these medications and realized that they had taken a considerable toll on me emotionally, physically, mentally. I strongly advise that before anyone decides to go this route for pain management that you have a long talk with your Physician on the pros and cons of this medication specifically the Oxycontin. If I would have known then what I know now about all the negative side effects I would never, never had started taking it. I feel that it deteriorated my body (especially my muscle mass and skin). When I started taking the medication I was 37 and felt 25 and was told I looked like I was in my late 20's, I am now 42, I feel 50 and now in an effort to spare my feelings people don't mention anything about how old I look . I wish that my Physicians would have told me about ALL of the negative effects of this medication instead of just the positive (which are few). In my opinion the negative far outweigh the positive.

I occasionally experienced difficulty reaching orgasm in the course of sexual activity, but did not experience reduced sex drive or difficulty attaining a full erection (I'm honestly not sure whether to rate this as a side effect or a benefit).","The benefits of Effexor XR were terrific. The side effects while taking it were just fine with me, though my psychiatrist seemed alarmed about my heart rate and blood pressure. That said, the withdrawal was so atrociously horrible it simply wasn't worth taking. I would have rather taken a drug that was half as effective without this uniquely gross withdrawal. Let me put this into perspective: I've gone through nicotine, alcohol, and speed withdrawal (the last a long time ago) and the Effexor was the worst (and I required hospitalization for the alcohol). It took me between three and four months to taper off the drug. I tried to stop --unsuccessfully--at 75% the regular dose, then 50%, and then 25% before deciding to just taper it down to a dose so small I had a hard time believing it had any psychoactive effects at all. Even finally quitting taking the drug at all when I'd tapered down to 1/15th the initial dose, I experienced mild versions of the same awful withdrawal issues that had popped up before: intermittent (intense!) nausea (previously full blown vomiting on previous quitting attempts), night sweats, what I've read in Effexor forums described-inadequately-as ""brain shivers,"" though-- amusingly enough-- very little of the depression or anxiety rebound past the first few days of 0 mg.

For the first month I felt exceptionally good and I was telling everyone how great it was but the euphoria came crashing down and I went into a deep depression.

If you are one of the many that gets burned by this medication be warned that the doctors will probably not be able to help you and will most likely deny that anything is even happening to you or that it is related to Champix and the side effects may be permanent.  I had a similar reaction in respect to rage and disinhibition from taking Zoloft when I was younger which altered my life substantially and now Champix has put the nail in the coffin.  Apparently these two drugs have a similar mechanism but Pfizer with held this information and marketed the drug in a deceiving way not mentioning any of the neuro-psychiatric and mind altering side effects of the drug when it first hit the market in order to boost sales of their poison.  The medical community has know for quite some time that dopamine plays a role in mood regulation and the fact the Champix targets the �pleasure centre� of the brain makes them grossly negligent for not investigating this further and informing consumers.  Many people including myself (I turned down a prescription of Zyban due to my experience with Zoloft) would not have taken it if we would have been informed of the risks and Pfizer knew that.  SHAME ON THEM FOR RUINING MY LIFE AND MANY OTHERS INCLUDING THOSE WHOM ENDED THE MISERY BY TAKING THEIR OWN LIFE.

1,lexapro,Marginally Effective,Severe Side Effects,anxiety,"Initially, Lexapro helped alleviate some of the stress I was experiencing. I noticed that situations that would normally aggravate me (i.e. stress of work, children, college assignments,etc.) I was able to handle better.","Although some stress was alleviated, I noticed that I spent more time in a ""vegetative"" state. I am normally a very active person who enjoys exercising daily. While on Lexapro, I found myself preferring to just relax and watch televison (did cause slight weight gain due to this). More serious and traumatizing side effects was the sudden onset of severe chest pain, rapid heartbeat, dizzy spells, sweating, fatigue, numbness in legs and nausea. The first episode occurred one day at work causing an ambulance to be dispatched to job. From that day on, these attacks happened quite frequently, my doctor took me off the medicine. However, these attacks continued to occur for over a year later (never happened to me before Lexapro). In fact, these effects started a two year long string of attacks, visits to cardiologists, emergency rooms, my fear of exercising as increased activity seemed to affect my heart and induce rapid heart beat. I began to fear driving as my dizzy spells would occur for no apparent reason, as well as the numbness in my legs. No doctor was much help, in fact I often got treated as if I was crazy and was just told that I am suffering from panic attacks. I understand that panic attacks can occur out of nowhere in ones life and once you have them you may experience continued anxiety. I believe the Lexapro opened this pandoras box for me though. I read somewhere that an earlier version of Lexapro (or similar type of pill) caused heart problems thus was pulled off the shelves. Who knows the story behind that. It has taken me two long horrific years to get back on track. I am now approaching my issues naturally and am doing better (not to say this completely stopped my life - but it did seriously change it).","I took approximately 5mg a day. I visited my doctor on monthly basis, and was in contact with her via phone during first several weeks (my doc was old school... she really cares about her patients).

Neck Pain","I have been taking minocycline 100mg twice a day. At first I had no side effects what so ever. However after a week I started heaving headaches and they gradually got worse. It was when I started having neck pains, I stopped using Minocycline. Although I stopped using it, I never thought the pains were due to it - I thought it was from going out right after the shower which I often do. That same night I woke up with hives appearing in my body and towards the end of the day, my face got swollen (eyes and my inner lip.) At first I thought it was a food allergy, went to the doctor and got a full blood test (White blood cells, red cells, cholesterol, sugar, full allergy, almost everything.)

During the waiting period of my results (took about a week and a half) I was taking steroid pills for allergies and I got back to normal within 5 days. On the 8th day, I was like hmm lets take minocycline again, I wanna be proactive and not break out on acne again. I took one pill at night after 8 days of not using it, and the next day I got itchy hands and a few hives and then I realized it was the minocycline that I was reacting to. Luckily I only took one pill and over the counter allergy medicine such as zyrtec got rid off my itchiness and I am back to normal again.



So around 8-9 days later after I gave blood, the results came to my doctor. To my surprise everything came normal no allergies what so ever, no pollen, no nuts, no nuts, no dust completely NO ALLERGIES. My Red Blood cell count along with hematocrit came a little high but nothing else.

I have done research into this phenomenon, and must warn all that this seems to occur most often in indiviguals with dopamine/GABA reuptake variants- such as those with ADHD, Parkinsons, and also PTSD.  Diazepam is a ""bandaid"" and offers no long-term therapeutic benefit whatsoever.  In fact, ""rebound"" anxiety and profound depression are common.

1,lexapro,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,clinical depression,The treatment benefits were very minimal because of the severe rage that I experienced. I don't think I benefited at all from taking this drug.,"This drug was very toxic to my system because it caused severe rage. I really was never relieved from my clinical depression because I kept hoping that the drug benefits would kick in and kept on taking it until one day I realized that I had to stop taking it. After about 2 months, I realized that I was very agitated constantly. I just thought that it would eventually go away but it never did. My nervousness was getting extreme. One day, I was in a grocery store shopping, pushing a grocery cart, and a little boy walked in front of me pushing a toy cart. I was so agitated that I had an INTENSE DESIRE to ram him with my shopping cart. I realized that this behavior was NOT ME and that the Lexapro was causing the severe rage. I also had a constant desire to start running down the street as fast as I could and NOT stop. I also couldn't sleep at night and if I was able to go to sleep finally, I would only stay asleep for a few hours. I sure hope this medication is taken off the market because it could cause some unstable patients to take other's lives from the severe rage.","This medication is manufactured by Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of Forest Laboratories, Inc. in St. Louis Missouri 63045. I was given the prescription of taking 10 mg. once a day. I cannot even imagine what would have happened to me if I had taken the full dosage recommended of 20 mg. I would have probably hurt someone badly. I have always suffered from clinical depression and have taken many different medications. Right now, Paxil is helping me with my depression a little. I think that I need to have it ""upped"" because the usual dosage isn't as effective as it once was. Anyway, my psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro for me because he really believed that this new drug would be just perfect for me. I had no idea that it would cause such turmoil in my life. I was in a constant state of nervousness and my panic attacks had started to get much worse. I just thought that my daily routine was the cause for my anxiety but realized when I had the desire to shove my shopping cart into a little boy who walked in front of me in the store, as I stated before in this report, that I had to quit taking Lexapro. Sometimes, I would sit on my sofa at night and want so badly to just scream at the top of my lungs. My therapist just told me to take a pillow, put it over my face, and scream at the top of my lungs. I was afraid that my neighbors would call the police if they heard me. That was no way to live. This medication was so toxic to me that if I had not realized what it was doing to me, I might have even taken my own life. Because of my great faith in God, I didn't kill myself and finally realized that I had to call my doctor immediately the next morning to report what Lexapro was doing to me. I also have a friend who is taking Lexapro and has taken it for sometime. She also shows signs of rage at times. Just a minor infringement on her and she will go into a state of rage (but not as bad as I did). I have tried to tell her that she needs to get off Lexapro but she just thinks that OTHER people are intimidating her. One day, when she rams her car into someone elses because they pulled in front of her, she will finally realize that Lexapro is not the drug for HER either. I really do think that Lexapro should be taken off the market until further testing is done. I would NEVER recommend this drug to anyone. It is just too unstable.", treatment rage think drug drug system rage depression drug kick kept day stop go nervousness extreme day grocery store shopping grocery cart boy front cart desire ram cart behavior lexapro rage desire start street stop sleep night go sleep stay hope medication market cause take rage medication subsidiary louis missouri prescription day imagine have dosage mg. have someone have depression depression think have dosage psychiatrist drug be perfect idea cause turmoil life state nervousness panic get routine cause anxiety desire shove cart boy front store report quit sit sofa night scream top therapist take pillow face scream top call police way live medication have life faith god kill call doctor morning report friend rage infringement go state rage have tell get lexapro day car someone front realize drug either do think lexapro be market testing recommend drug anyone

I also had a very hard time withdrawing from it. I tried several times but fell into severe depression and had to start taking it again.  I thought I'd have to be on it for life.

1,actiq,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,chronic pain,"Without question, Actiq is an extremely effective drug if you are in chronic severe pain and have no responsibilities.  Actiq relaxes the body and the brain becomes numb and able to handle ongoing pain effectively.  It is fast acting in the subcutaneous, ""lollipop"" form and within minutes you are comfortable.
The flavor is also quite pleasant.","Actiq, when taken as directed, induces a feeling of numbness. and slurred speech is common. Thinking becomes confused and it is not unusual to fall asleep in mid-sentence. Actiq slows breathing and causes extreme tiredness.  Actiq are highly addictive and it is literally impossible to stop taking them without a medical detoxification.
Actiq delivered in subcutaneous form causes the teeth to rot after extended use of more than 6 months.","Actiq should only be taken by individuals who are in severe, chronic pain where
tolerance to the drug will not become problematic.  It needs to be closely monitored and locked away out of reach of children or any adult who may have problems with addiction.
My  chronic  pain condition was followed by a Pain Center at a reputable hospital.  The use of opioids were used only after all other treatments for
my condition had failed.
Unfortunately, once Actiq was introduced to me, my medical problems worsened, although my pain was under control.  I was unable to function responsibly, began dealing with symptoms of withdrawal whenever I didn't take it, which at times became worse than my actual pain and discomfort.  I became more of a patient to my family and on a side note, at age 40 lost 4 molars due to the ingredients present in the ""lollipops"" I was taking.
I had no choice but to be hospitalized for an inpatient medical detox in order to safely get this horrible drug out of my body.  Fortunately my husband and I were fortunate enought to have the money to go through this detox program.
I have no memory of 2 years of my life, thanks to an ignorant, negligent doctor and the drug, Actiq.

Less moodiness.,"Weight gain, extreme tiredness during the day, insomnia at night, bad effect on libido and sexual ability. Extreme lethargy.","I was on Zoloft for about 2 years total. I am extremely sensitive to medication, so I started at a dose of 25 mgs. and slowly titrated up to 100 mgs. I was unaware that this was probably too high of a dose for me. It subsequently caused me to start taking other prescriptions to mitigate some side effects. My doctor prescribed Ritalin and Focalin for the lethargy and fatigue side effects that I experienced during the day, and Ambien for the insomnia that Zoloft caused. I am still on Ambien to this day. 

The worst effect of Zoloft came when I tried to get off of it. It was total, utter hell. I have since found out that this is euphemistically called, ""discontinuation Syndrome."" 

I first cut the dose down to 50 mgs. and did not experience problems. I then slowly titrated down over several months until I came off of it completely. Over the next few weeks, I started experiencing strange, tingling sensations down my body, panic attacks, (which I had never experienced before), and extreme nausea - which became so bad, I lost 20 pounds in 6 weeks. This was all extremely traumatic as I am a type 1 diabetic who needs to eat to balance the insulin I take. The panic attacks got so bad, I had to be on Xanax XR everyday for months. I could not function normally or work. I tried to stick it out because I didn't want to go back on an SSRI after all the trouble and side effects it caused. I went to a MD who was also an alternative care specialist, thinking he could give me St. Johns Wort and I could manage with that until I got over the physical side effects of the SSRI, but it didn't work. I eventually had to go back on an SSRI just to function normally. I am on Lexapro now. I managed to be drug free for the first 40 years of my life (except for insulin), and now because of the aftermath of Zoloft, I am on Ambien, Lexapro, and Valium occasionally for anxiety. To top that off, the alternative doctor put me on a supplement that ended up being an anabolic steroid (which he called a 'nutritional supplement' and I ended up having to go on even more medication to fight the side effects that I incurred from that.

The family attempted to talk about the changes with the patient but as true delusional behavior dictates, the patient was unable to see any of the changes.  The forgetfulness, clumsiness, and personality changes such as irritability increased.  The family attempted to contact the psychiatrist but in interim, the patient died of a cardiac arrest.

1,lamotrigine,Marginally Effective,Severe Side Effects,bipolar disorder,"I felt better for the first few days, mood-wise.  But then I got depressed again.  So I guess that's not a benefit.","I've always been one to freak out at the slightest appearance of illness - I have anxiety as well as bipolar disorder.  When I was told that lamotrigine (the first drug I've been on for bipolar) caused a potentially fatal rash, I decided that this time, I was going to try not to worry.  One out of ten people experience a rash on the drug - and I tried to be rational - that means I'm likely to be one of the nine that doesn't.

Oh, was I ever wrong.

Firstly, the lamotrigine didn't help with moods.  I wanted to die for two days more badly than I ever had in my life on this drug. It was excruciating.  Luckily, I have a lot of support, and I (obviously) didn't kill myself.

I couldn't sleep.  I lay awake most nights until 7am.  I eventually passed out and got maybe 4-6 hours of sleep.  This is barely better than the sleep I get when I'm hypomanic.  And we all know how bad it is when bipolar people don't sleep.  Luckily, the meds did seem to keep me from going upwards mood-wise.  I also had to pee ALL THE TIME, which was not fun.

That brings me to the rash.
I first noticed a few raised bumps on my inner forearms.  I thought it would go away, that I shouldn't freak out - I wasn't going to get the rash, right?  And the next morning, I was covered in a slightly raised, red rash, even on my face and hands.  I went to the clinic, and the doctor said I was having an allergic reaction.  He told me to just go home and stop taking the lamotrigine.  He knew nothing about it or the fact that it causes rashes.  It got worse, and by night-time I was freaked out.  I called a nurse and she told me to go to the emergency room.  I did, and they had me stay the night to make sure I didn't have Steven Johnson Syndrome.  Luckily, I don't.  I just have something called ""drug eruption.""

Even if it's not going to kill me, it's never fun being covered in red blotches.  I still am and it's been three days.  I'm afraid to go to the Starbucks around the corner.  My verdict?  Lamictal isn't worth it.  Don't risk it.","I was put on 12.5mg, then 25mg, and we were going to keep raising the dose slowly to minimize risk.", i benefit i freak appearance illness anxiety disorder lamotrigine drug i bipolar rash time try worry out rash drug be be oh lamotrigine help die life drug lot support kill sleep sleep get i sleep seem keep mood-wise pee time rash inner thought go freak get rash right morning rash face clinic doctor reaction go home stop lamotrigine nothing fact night-time nurse go emergency room stay night make have syndrome have something drug eruption kill i go corner verdict lamictal risk .5mg keep slowly minimize risk

PLEASE< PLEASE read on....,"If you take a look at the side effects the FDA requires Provigil manufacturer Cephalon to list, you will find the usual stomach aches, headaches etc.. Such side effects are so common that virtually every new prescription medication ends up listing them, which is why most of us don't bother reading the side effect profile for meds. However, failing to look at the side effects for Provigil could end up costing you your life. Provigil of course does list the usual side effects, yes, but ther is one side effect listed that is rarely included as a medication side effect.  Further, even if you should happen to actually read the list of Provigil's side you are not likely to know what it means. The side effect is called ""vasodilatation"", and the manufacturer reported to the FDA that it occurred to 1 out of every 50 test subjects while it happened to 0 out of every 50 who took the placebo. What is ""vasodilatation""?  Vasodilatation, nearly always referred to as the more recognizable ""vasodilation"", refers to the general relaxation of blood vessels, a phenomenon that usually ends up causing a small drop in blood pressure but sometimes causes a significant blood pressure drop, when it is then called hypotension.  And, if you'll read on, you'll see why for me, and potentially for 1 out of every 50 users of Provigil, it very nearly killed me.  

After 7 weeks on Provigil, with the last week having been increased from 200mg to 300mg per day, I awoke one morning in a highly delusional state, speaking of non-existent farm animals wandering around the kitchen table where my wife and I were seated. After apparently collapsing in my bedroom, I was taken to ER, which quickly determined that I was critically hypotensive (low blood pressure of 72/35). I quickly lapsed into cardiogenic shock, a condition where the heart all but stops pumping blood and one of the deadliest of all medical crises. Even among those who are still alive upon arrival at an ER,  70% to 80% die within hours or a few days. Those who survive likely do so, as I did, with kidneys in acute failure and brain damage similar to what is sustained by near-drowning victims who have been resuscitated by a lengthy CPR session.","My ER doctor immediately paged the cardiologist on call. Arriving quickly, he assessed my condition and determined that my only chance of survival was a transport to a regional heart center 35 miles away. As he awaited the ambulance, he took me to my local hospital's heart catheterization lab, not to put a stent in, but to push a tiny balloon through  my femoral artery to a destination next to my aorta, after which a tiny battery powered air pump was used to inflate the balloon and keep it inflated. The balloon (called an intra-aortic balloon pump) works by temporarily filling the empty space around the heart, then applying continuous gentle pressure to my aorta in an effort to keep my blood pressure from additional falling past the small amount that would otherwise kill me. Arriving at the heart center I was unconscious and would lapse into a coma for 9 days, kept alive by mechanical ventilation through a tube inserted through my throat to my lungs (""I'm in"", the TV doctors always say when the get the insertion right).", please please read look side fda manufacturer cephalon list find stomach side prescription medication bother side effect profile look side provigil end life provigil course list side side effect medication side effect happen read list provigil side know side effect vasodilatation manufacturer fda test placebo vasodilatation vasodilatation vasodilation relaxation blood drop blood pressure blood pressure drop hypotension read see provigil provigil week mg mg day morning state speaking farm kitchen table wife bedroom er blood pressure /35 shock condition heart blood arrival er % % die failure brain damage cpr session doctor cardiologist call condition chance survival transport heart center ambulance hospital heart catheterization lab put stent push balloon artery destination aorta battery air pump inflate balloon keep balloon balloon pump space heart pressure aorta effort keep blood pressure amount otherwise kill heart center lapse coma ventilation tube throat i tv get insertion

I did have reoccuring episodes (TIA like - diagnosed as TIA for lack of conclusive evidence or further investigation)  I now believe it was mostly stress and menopause related issues.,"I do not know that all side effects were attributable to the Clonozapam alone or a combination of one or all drugs.  I did take just the Clonozapm and Lovastatin the first year.   Regardless, everytime I looked up a symptom on the web, it always pointed to MS.  My Neurologist did say we should investigate it, but we never did.  Anyway, I could not sleep for days on end, I had excessive hand tremors, voice tremors, unsteady gait, tintinnitus, eyesight problems, urinary problems, memory problems and a bunch more I can't even recall at the moment.  I weaned myself off the medicine in 3 months time and am very much improved but only after months and possibly years of being removed from all the problems.  I'd like to mention that at one point in time I took the cholesterol drug that Dr. Jarvis promotes...I can't remember the name and had to quit within the first week as it gave me pains in the front of my thighs that could take your breath away.  I know for a fact that that symptom was in fact attributable to that drug.  A good effect that came from that drug though was the almost immediate shrinkage of my breast cysts...I had many on both sides.  Upon starting on that drug, I could actually feel them draining, dissapating or whatever you might call it.  They have not returned, so I am very thankful for that aspect of the drug.  Because of the leg pain though, I found it intolerable.","I am not sure what you mean as I already told you that I was being treated for TIA like seizures with the Clonozapam and Aggrenox as a blood thinner for the same.  I also took Lovastatin for High Cholesterol.  In the course of all these medications I ended up getting a divorce.  The drugs did not lower my cholesterol... they made me more nervous and made me question what on earth was wrong with me?  I now weigh more than I ever have, and I started to gain wieght almost immediately after getting off of the drugs.  I could use to lose 20lbs, but I am not worried about it as I am so much healthier than I was during the time I was on all of the drugs.  I hope this has helped you in some way.

7. Bad experience for $200!!!","Hi! I am a russian (european race) who has migrated from Sweden to the USA. I have developed melasma (dark spots) under my eyes and on my forehead. I visited a dermatologist in the USA, FL about 1 month ago. He prescribed me Tri Luma that contains 4% of Hudroquinone. Have you ever read about Hydroquinone?- I asked him. As I investigated it I found the information that hydroquinone has been banned in many european countries including France, Sweden and Russia etc, for concerns about increased cancer risk.The FDA admitted that the risk of using the drug is not known and more testing needs to be done.In fact, the FDA also warned that hydroquinone has been linked to a condition that disfigures the skin. Anyway,I tried the cream, a sample that the doctor gave to me. He prescribed to use it twice a week - Mondays and Fridays. It was terrible!!! I used it just once a week on my pigment spots because my skin got red, burning and after 1 week it was peeling. Some doctors prescribe to use it once, twice a day!!! I put it on only once a week. Ok, after 1 month, 4 treatments I have the result: my pigment spots have not been improved at all. Moreover, the skin is burnt and now I have very obvious dark red-brown spots. I really look terrible. I can't put on any sunscreen because the skin is damaged by Tri Luma. I am so happy that I didn't buy the full size cream which costs $200 and the insurance doesn't cover it. I don't want to buy cancer for $200. Thanks. I've also contacted russian and swedish doctors. They've forbade to use it strongly!!!

1,advair-diskus,Marginally Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,copd,At first it helped.,"I did not realize at first that they were side effects. I thought that my chronic bronchitis had gotten much worse. Then I began to develop bouts of extreme fatigue, anxiety and occasional panic attacks that had nothing to do with COPD. Then I started to have choking fits. They were becoming so serious that I feared choking to death. I suspected Advair, so I tried not taking it and then taking it again. The cause was identified and I stopped taking Advair. The choking fits ceased. The fatigue, anxiety, and panic attacks were found to be a malfunciton of my adrenal gland (confimed by lab tests). The chronic bronchitis improved dramatically.","I was diagnosed with COPD about 12 years ago. I started taking Advair about eight years ago. During the course of treatment I tried Spiriva, but had to stop because it was very drying. At one time I was taking Singulair, but that didn't seem to do much of anything. So I quit that. Throughout the entire period I have used Duoneb and Zyrtec. I think I was originally put on 250/50 Advair. That was increased, some years back, to 500/50, and about two years ago reduced back to 250/50. At all times I used the Advair twice a day.

My pulmonologist (also primary care physician) was not much help when I developed side effects, nor did he suggest a substitute treatment when I had to stop using Advair. I went to another doctor who treated me for adrenal fatigue and had me take natural anti-inflammatories and mucolytics to replace the Advair. I still take Duoneb and Zyrtec. I stopped taking the Advair one year ago. I am just now recovering from the adrenal problem.

1,seasonique,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,have not stop bleeding,None,Bleeding not even Spotting,"Ladies: I am sure you may have done lots of researches by now regarding taking Seasonique (PLEASE do before you try to take this drug), and there are lots of negative than positive comments on this drug. I would like to point out a couple of my comments to share with you. I normally have 4 - 5 days menstrual periods every month. But I was not happy and tried to be on this drug because it described 4 periods only per year (WOW! what a great idea, especially I have small child, school, work, and husband). Guess what happen since then? I have been bleeding almost 2 weeks now, and from light to heavy, the worst part is I get all these uncomfortable cramps, keep waking up at night, my personalities change from good to bad, I have not been in a good mood since then. of course not, how can I be in a good mood when my vagina keeps bleeding on me every single day (I am sure no woman likes that), and so on. I spoke with my OB, and she said it's normal. I don't think so, it is completely not normal to me. I have been bleeding, and ruin my daily life style. No wonder it is called Birth Control. How can you have sex with your partner while you have all these symtomps in your body especially bleeding? I stop this drug, and can't wait to have my clean dates back.

Ladies: I am not saying all the women's body are the same. But if you want to be on this drug. I would advise you do more researches and read more comments before trying, and other advise is if you think it's a good idea for 4 periods per year, you may want to think twice. Because it's a mother nature for women that has 13 menstrual periods every year, trying to change it and playing with your hormones are the game, unless you like to gamble, then you may want to try this excitment drug, and hope you will win. Otherwise, please consider something else. I am so regret that I did not read all the comments and reviews before I asked my OB to put me on this drug. Therefore, I have to suffer what I deserve (I guess). I just don't want to see another woman to be suffered like me, as I finally found out there are lots of women out there are taking the same drug (before I made up my mind to throw this drug away) that are suffering the same symtomps but still want to continue and hopefully that will work one day. For me, ""no is no"". You can call me chicken or looser or whatsoever. But let me tell you, it is defintely not fun if the drug makes your life changes from okay to worse!
